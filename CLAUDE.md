# SyncSystem BackMeUp
Agent instructions for building a backup software.

## Development Setup
### Prerequisites
#### Required:
- Go 1.21 or higher (installation guide)
- Windows 10 (cross compatible with macOS)
- Air for live reload during development
Note: Consult me for anything else needed.

## Stack:
- Go (Golang)
- SQLite
- Application Configuration Management: yml file
- Accounts Configuration Management: Environment variables + encrypted database storage
- Frontend Framework: plain HTML + Alpine.js
- Logging Strategy: slog
- Job Queue / Async Processing: Web deployment: Add a jobs table to SQLite for persistence
- Authentication: No need for this now. Let's leave this for a future enhancement.
- File Chunking Strategy: Upload in 100MB chunks (however, I'd like a setting in the Application Configuration Management to change, if I need)
- Encryption Before Upload: No need - nothing secret in the backups
- Retry Logic & Error Handling
    retry_policy:
        max_attempts: 3
        initial_backoff_seconds: 2
        max_backoff_seconds: 60
        backoff_multiplier: 2  # Exponential backoff
- Rate Limiting
    rate_limits:
        mega:
            requests_per_second: 10
            bandwidth_mb_per_second: 5
        4shared:
            requests_per_second: 5
            bandwidth_mb_per_second: 3
- Concurrency Controls
    concurrency:
        max_concurrent_uploads: 2      # Total uploads across all accounts
        max_concurrent_per_account: 1  # Avoid overwhelming single account
        max_workers: 5                  # Goroutine pool size

- Storage Quota Tracking:
    quota_sync_interval_minutes: 60
    sync_method: api_polling  # Poll cloud APIs for current usage
    cache_quota_in_db: true   # Store in SQLite for offline access
    quota_sync_interval_minutes: 60  # Check quotas hourly

- Metadata Database Backup: I'll want an automatic backup to a "main" account (online)
- Verification/Integrity Checks: 
    verification:
        enabled: true
        verify_on_upload: true       # Download first chunk, compare checksum
        periodic_check_days: 30      # Re-verify random files monthly

## Code Style
- Use LF line endings.


## Specs
- The goal is to upload zipped files to the accounts with the help of the application we're building.
- We'll have an .env file that we'll define the the main account (in which the db will be uploaded at every end of a successful job) and all the other accounts.
- We'll build integration for MEGA and 4shared. However, I'd like for it to be built in a way that we could add other cloud storage as we need, with focused refactor.
- The user will define the target directory to backup. The application will scan its subdirectories (only first level and second level deep) to later record in the database related to that storage, along with the meta data for the date created.
- The user will have the option to upload to only one storage or both storages (or as many as it's integrated to the application in future refactor).
  - Manually selects which accounts are configured for MEGA and 4shared - two separate columns with checkboxes for each account. In the side of each account checkbox, there should be the quota.
- The user will insert the "title" of the backup (example: xxx), and the application will create a main record for the xxx and record all subdirectories related to that main backup record.
- As the user selects the directory, the application zips it and uploads to the selected storages selected by the user, in the cloud root.
  - The name of the zip file will be reflected by the name of the directory the user pointed to zip.
    - Temporary space to zip the file will be at the same level the directory pointed to exists.
  - App checks total size vs available quota across accounts.
    - If it the account doesn't have the capacity for the intended upload, it warns with a modal and doesn't allow to proceed.
  - App creates job record in database (status: pending).
  - UI redirects to "Jobs" view showing progress.
  - Background worker picks up job, starts chunked upload.
  - Progress updates in real-time (WebSocket or polling every 2 sec).
    - Ability to resume unsuccessful uploads from where it stopped.
  - On completion: verify first chunk checksum.
  - On success: delete temp zip, mark job complete, backup database.
    - Update the quota for that specific account.
  - On failure: mark job failed, keep temp zip for retry.
### Table
- In the table layout, the user would see something like this:
  - title
  - MEGA (true / false)
  - MEGA Status (pending / in progress / complete or available / fail)
    - On fail, log the type of error in the DB.
    - Provide a button to open a modal to check all the logs from that provider / account.
  - MEGA Download (the zipped file from the storage)
  - MEGA Delete (deletes the record and the zip file in the storage, with a confirmation that I have to type "DELETE")
    - Delete only from the provider.
  - MEGA Upload date
  - 4shared (true / false)
  - 4shared Status (pending / in progress / complete or available / fail)
    - On fail, log the type of error in the DB.
    - Provide a button to open a modal to check all the logs from that provider / account.
  - 4shared Download (the zipped file from the storage)
  - 4shared Delete (deletes the record and the zip file in the storage, with a confirmation that I have to type "DELETE")
    - Delete only from the provider.
  - 4shared Upload date
  - The row would be an accordion that would expand to show the 2 levels of the directories present in the main record.
  - In the bottom of everything, there should be counters for:
    - Total GB
    - Total backup main records
### Other Features
- I'd like a search bar that would search for the subdirectories names in the database, and return me the titles (and date created) that contains that search term.
- I'd like an option "See Accounts Available", where it lists all the accounts (two columns) with their quota.


### .env File Format:

# Main account for database backup
MAIN_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER=mega
MAIN_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=main@example.com
MAIN_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=encryptedpass123

# MEGA accounts (numbered)
MEGA_ACCOUNT_1_EMAIL=mega1@example.com
MEGA_ACCOUNT_1_PASSWORD=pass1
MEGA_ACCOUNT_1_QUOTA_GB=20

MEGA_ACCOUNT_2_EMAIL=mega2@example.com
MEGA_ACCOUNT_2_PASSWORD=pass2
MEGA_ACCOUNT_2_QUOTA_GB=20

# 4shared accounts
FOURSHARED_ACCOUNT_1_EMAIL=4s1@example.com
FOURSHARED_ACCOUNT_1_PASSWORD=pass3
FOURSHARED_ACCOUNT_1_QUOTA_GB=15

# Add more as needed...


## Documentation
- Provide a README.md concise with the features, how to use it and troubleshoot.
- Update CLAUDE.md and files in project's .claude directory as needed. Especially after troubleshooting stuff that's worth noting.

## Workflow
- Divide each chunk of the work into PRs.
- For every chunk, create a new branch.
- Build commits however it makes better sense.
- Push the commits however it makes sense.
- Let me manually validate each chunk of work / PR before moving to the next one.
- Provide PR description in dev-tools/prompts/output/pr-descriptions/number-of-pr.md
  - BTW: This directory shouldn't be pushed to the repo.
- This is the github repo: https://github.com/syncsystem-net/back-me-up.git (totally blank)
- Use 2 sub-agents:
  - One to carry out the work.
  - The other to verify if the work is being done according to plan.
